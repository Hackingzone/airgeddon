#Features
- Interface mode switcher (Monitor-Managed).<br>
- DoS over wireless networks with different methods.<br>
- Assisted Handshake file capture.<br>
- Cleaning and optimizing Handshake captured files.<br>
- Offline password decrypt on WPA/WPA2 captured files (dictionary, bruteforce and rule based).<br>
- Compatibility with many Linux distros (see requirements section).<br>
- Easy targeting and selection in every section.<br>
- Drag and drop files on console window for entering file paths.<br>
- Controlled Exit. Cleaning tasks and temp files. Option to keep monitor mode if desired.<br>
- Multilanguage support and autodetect OS language feature (see supported languages section).<br>
- Help hints in every zone/menu for easy use.<br>
- Auto-update. Script checks for newer version if possible.<br>

#Requirements
Bash version 4.0 or later needed.<br>
<br>
Tested on these compatible Linux distros:<br>
*-Kali 2.0 and 2016.1*<br>
*-Wifislax 4.11.1 and 4.12*<br>
*-Backbox 4.5.1*<br>
*-Parrot 2.2.1*<br>
*-Blackarch 2016.01.10*<br>
*-Cyborg Hawk 1.1*<br>
*-Debian 7 (Wheezy) and 8 (Jessie)*<br>
*-Ubuntu/Xubuntu 15.10 and 16.04*<br>
*-OpenSUSE Leap 42.1*<br>
*-CentOS 6 and 7*<br>
*-Gentoo 20160514*<br>
*-Fedora 24*<br>
*-Red Hat 7 (Maipo)*<br>
<br>
Anyway, can be used with any Linux distro if you have installed the tools what script needs. The script checks for them at the beginning.<br><br>
Essential tools: <- *the script doesn't work if you don't have installed all of them*<br>
`iwconfig iw awk airmon-ng airodump-ng aircrack-ng xterm`<br><br>
Optional tools: <- *not necessary to work, only needed for some features*<br>
`wpaclean crunch aireplay-ng mdk3 hashcat`<br><br>
Update tools: <- *not necessary to work, only used for auto-update*<br>
`curl`<br>
<br>
Impossible compatibility for Mac OSX at the moment. Some reasons:<br>
*-Bash version* <- it can be avoided upgrading to 4 or later, this is not the real problem :)<br>
*-Aircrack suite* <- this suite for OSX doesn't support airodump and aireplay<br>
*-Wireless tools* <- iwconfig doesn't exists for OSX, and airport command can't be used. It generates very different outputs<br>
