- Easy targeting and selection in every section.<br/>
- Drag and drop files on console window for entering file paths.<br/>
- Screen resolution detection for optimal windows viewing.<br/>
- Controlled Exit. Cleaning tasks and temp files. Option to keep monitor mode if desired.<br/>
- Multilanguage support and autodetect OS language feature (see supported languages section).<br/>
- Help hints in every zone/menu for easy use.<br/>

#Requirements
Bash version 4.0 or later needed.<br/>
<br/>
Tested on these compatible Linux distros:<br/>
*-Kali 2.0 and 2016.1*<br/>
*-Wifislax 4.11.1 and 4.12*<br/>
*-Backbox 4.5.1*<br/>
*-Parrot 2.2.1*<br/>
*-Blackarch 2016.01.10*<br/>
*-Cyborg Hawk 1.1*<br/>
*-Debian 7 (Wheezy) and 8 (Jessie)*<br/>
*-Ubuntu/Xubuntu 15.10 and 16.04*<br/>
*-OpenSUSE Leap 42.1*<br/>
*-CentOS 6 and 7*<br/>
*-Gentoo 20160514*<br/>
*-Fedora 24*<br/>
*-Red Hat 7 (Maipo)*<br/>
*-Arch 4.6.2-1*<br/>
*-Raspbian 7 (Wheezy) and 8 (Jessie)*<br/>
<br/>
It's already available in <a href="https://archstrike.org/wiki" target="_blank">ArchStrike</a> repositories used by some distros based on Arch Linux.<br/>
Repositories versions will have auto-update feature disabled in order to avoid breaking dependencies. There is a var at the beginning of the file, *"auto_update"* can be set to 0 to turn off the auto-update feature.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, can be used with any Linux distro if you have installed the tools what script needs. The script checks for them at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Essential tools: <- *the script doesn't work if you don't have installed all of them*
```
iwconfig
iw
awk
airmon-ng
airodump-ng
aircrack-ng
xterm
```
Optional tools: <- *not necessary to work, only needed for some features*
```
wpaclean
crunch
aireplay-ng
mdk3
hashcat
hostapd
dhcpd (isc-dhcp-server)
```
Update tools: <- *not necessary to work, only used for auto-update*<br/>
```
curl
```

#Known incompatibilities
Impossible compatibility for Mac OSX at the moment. Some reasons:<br/>
*-Bash version* <- it can be avoided upgrading to 4 or later, this is not the real problem :)<br/>
*-Aircrack suite* <- this suite for OSX doesn't support airodump and aireplay<br/>
*-Wireless tools* <- iwconfig doesn't exists for OSX, and airport command can't be used. It generates very different outputs<br/>

Incompatible with OpenBSD and FreeBSD. They are Unix systems but they have some differences with Linux:<br/>
*-Bash* <- They have no bash. It can be installed, this is not the real problem<br/>
*-Wireless tools* <- iwconfig doesn't exists for these systems, they use ifconfig instead and it generates very different outputs

#Use
Under some distros like Kali Linux must be launched only using bash (not sh). Example `bash /path/airgeddon.sh`<br/>
Under Wifislax Linux and others, it can be launched using bash or sh. Example `sh /path/airgeddon.sh`<br/>
If you launch the script using sh and a *"Syntax error"* appears, launch it with bash instead of sh.<br/>

#Supported Languages
English, Spanish, French, Catalan and Portuguese.

#Project Collaboration
You can join the project:<br/>
-Translations to other languages are welcome.<br/>
-More distros support compatibility.<br/>
-New features.<br/>
-Testing and feedback is needed too.<br/>
<br/>
*For collaborating translators:*<br/>
You can take the strings to translate from the code or you can ask me directly by mail. I'll inform you how to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
*For collaborating developers:*<br/>
Debug mode was implemented for faster development skipping intro and initial checks. Use it setting var *"debug_mode"* to 1<br/>
Please, respect the code style and the UTF-8 files format only using at the end of the lines LF (not CRLF).<br/>
<br/>
*For beta testers:*<br/>
You can download the master version or the beta testing version from the development branch called `dev`
